## Working with the `selligent.json`

The following properties can be used in the `selligent.json` to further configure the behaviour of the native SDKs.

> The values should be relevant to your configuration. There are parameters that can only be used on a specific platform, but can be set and will be ignored in the other platform.

## Push notifications

Follow the [iOS](https://github.com/SelligentMarketingCloud/MobileSDK-iOS/tree/master/Documentation#create-an-apns-key) & [Android](https://github.com/SelligentMarketingCloud/MobileSDK-Android/tree/master/Documentation#creating-an-application) native SDKs guides in order to optin for push notifications in Apple & Google.

**For Android**, if targeting API level 33 and above:

1. Add the following line to AndroidManifest.xml:

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
    ```

2. Add this native code to request the push permission and let the SDK know when it is accepted, in the activity where you want to:

    ```java
    import com.selligent.RNSelligent;
    
    public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
      final int NOTIFICATION_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE = 1111;
    
      @Override
      public void onStart()
      {
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT > Build.VERSION_CODES.S_V2)
        {
          if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED)
          {
            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS}, NOTIFICATION_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE);
          }
        }
        
        super.onStart();
      }
    
      @Override
      public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults)
      {
          super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    
          if (requestCode == NOTIFICATION_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE)
          {
              if (grantResults.length > 0 && grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED)
              {
                  RNSelligent.enableNotifications();
              }
          }
      }
    ```

**For iOS**:

1. For push notifications you need to delegate some of the `AppDelegate.m` methods to the SDK:

    ```objc
    // In AppDelegate.h
    #import <React/RCTBridgeDelegate.h>
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

    @import UserNotifications;

    @interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, RCTBridgeDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>

    @property (nonatomic, strong) UIWindow *window;

    @end
    ```

    ```objc
    // In AppDelegate.m
    #import "AppDelegate.h"
    #import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
    #import <React/RCTRootView.h>

    #import <React/RCTAppSetupUtils.h>
    
    @import RNSelligentMobileSDK;
    // OR
    // #import <RNSelligentMobileSDK/RNSelligentMobileSDK-Swift.h>

    @implementation AppDelegate

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
        center.delegate = self;

        // RN Setup Code

        [RNSelligent configureWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
      
        return YES;
    }

    - (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData*)deviceToken {
        [RNSelligent didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
    }

    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
        [RNSelligent didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
    }

    - (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions options))completionHandler {
        [RNSelligent willPresentNotification:notification withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
    }

    - (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response withCompletionHandler:(void(^)(void))completionHandler {
        [RNSelligent didReceiveNotificationResponse:response withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
    }

    @end
    ```

2. Follow section [**Create an APNS Key**](https://github.com/SelligentMarketingCloud/MobileSDK-iOS/tree/master/Documentation#apns_key), of the native documentation.

3. Somewhere in your ReactNative app (normally done as soon as possible but can also be done when certain page is reached), you will need to call `Selligent.enableNotifications` to prompt the user for the push notification permission or the `Selligent.registerForProvisionalRemoteNotification` (This option is only available for iOS 12+) if you want to get a provisional permission before asking the user for the normal one.

    ```javascript
    import Selligent from "@selligent-marketing-cloud/selligent-react-native"; // Add Marigold Engage import
    
    if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
        Selligent.enableNotifications(
            (response) => { // success callback
            },
            (error) => { // error callback
            },
            true
        )
    }
    
    Selligent.registerForProvisionalRemoteNotification(
        () => { // success callback
        }
    )
    ```

### Rich Push Notifications

**For iOS**, you will need to implement notification extensions and set the `appGroupId` in the `selligent.json` file.
Then, follow the [native iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/SelligentMarketingCloud/MobileSDK-iOS/edit/master/Documentation/README.md#notification-extensions).

### Deep Linking

Depending on your React version, it might be that deeplinks behind push notifications do not work when the App is killed.
This is because the JS layer is loaded **after** the native SDK executes the deeplink, so the JS event listeners are not there yet. If you want to fix this, follow the below steps (make sure to build for Release when testing this).

1. Add the `delayedPushAction` property in `selligent.json` file and set it to `true`

2. Implement (if not there yet) a linking handler in your ReactNative codebase (i.e <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking>)

3. Add a call to `Selligent.executePushAction()` in your main `App.js` file, after adding the ReactNative linking handler (and after calling `Selligent.subscribeToEvents`, if being used)

    ```javascript
    import Selligent from "@selligent-marketing-cloud/selligent-react-native" // Add Marigold Engage import

    const App = () => {
    // Deeplinking handling library (i.e Linking.getInitialURL() & Linking.addEventListener...)
    // useHandleDeepLink()

    /* Tells the Marigold Engage SDK to execute the action associated to the last push clicked, when using `delayedPushAction` feature.
    If you are having problems with deeplinks or 'Push + InApp Message' where the splash screen gets stuck or the push action not visible,
    make sure you control when the splash screen is dismissed (i.e https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/) and call this method afterwards (if the dismiss is async, call this method once the async process is completely finished)
    */
    Selligent.executePushAction()
    ```

#### Background Modes

**For iOS**, (if your app supports Background Modes) it is possible that after the app is launched from the background (location update, background push notification...) if the next action the user performs is executing a deeplink (via safari, push notification click...) the deeplink won't do anything. This is because the communication between the native part and the RN layer is not ready yet when the deeplink is executed from the native side. To workaround this, you can catch when the app is launched from the background and add a bit of delay before the `RCTLinkingManager openUrl` gets executed.

```objective-c
static BOOL launchedFromBackground = false;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  if ([[UIApplication sharedApplication] applicationState] == UIApplicationStateBackground) {
    launchedFromBackground = true;
  }
  
  // Other setup code
  
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options {
  if (launchedFromBackground) {
    launchedFromBackground = false;
    
    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, 0.5 * NSEC_PER_SEC), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
      [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
    });
    
    return [super application:application openURL:url options:options];
  }
  
  return [super application:application openURL:url options:options] || [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
}
```

#### Universal Linking - iOS

By default, universal links in a button from a Push/IAM will open the default browser, to avoid this and catch them on the App and apply any logic you want, you will need to add a property `interceptSelligentUniversalLinks` in the `selligent.json` with `true` as value.

You can then subscribe to `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.UNIVERSAL_LINK_EXECUTED` event through the `Selligent.subscribeToEvents` whose execution callback will get triggered when a `deeplink` button type is defined in Marigold Engage (whose URL scheme is `http` or `https`).
The response of the success callback is an object which contains information on the type of broadcast event and the data attached to it.

| Property           | Type                                                    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| data               | object                                                  | Contains more information specific to the type of broadcast event |
| broadcastEventType | [enum](#broadcasteventtype)                             | The type of broadcast event                                       |

The `data` property is an object itself containing more information specific to the type of the broadcast event:

- UNIVERSAL_LINK_EXECUTED:

    | Property | Type   | Description                                |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
    | url      | string | The executed URL as a string               |

```javascript
Selligent.subscribeToEvents(
    () => {}, 
    () => {},
    (response) => {
        if (response?.broadcastEventType === SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.UNIVERSAL_LINK_EXECUTED) {
            Alert.alert(response.data.url)
        }
    }
)
```

### Notification helper methods

#### Disable Marigold Engage Push Notifications

You can enable or disable Marigold Engage push notifications (not all push notifications for your app) by calling `Selligent.enableNotifications` anytime you want (do note that for iOS, the first call to this method will prompt the user for the push permission).

```javascript
Selligent.enableNotifications(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    (error) => { // error callback
    },
    true
)
```

#### Display last remote notification

If you want to display the last received push notification you can call `Selligent.displayLastReceivedNotification`.

```javascript
Selligent.displayLastReceivedRemotePushNotification()
```

#### Display last remote notification content

If you want to display the last received push notification content (usually an inapp message) you can call `Selligent.displayLastReceivedRemotePushNotification`. If the last push didn't have any content attached (just a simple push) then nothing will happen.
You can optionally pass a `templateId` parameter, which is a string, to specify which template should be used to personalize the styles of the inapp message (if any).

```javascript
Selligent.displayLastReceivedRemotePushNotification(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    "some template id" // If you want to use any specific template
)
```

#### Retrieve last remote notification

You can get the last received push notification banner details by calling `Selligent.getLastRemotePushNotification`.
The response is an object containing the `id`(string) and `title`(string) properties (or `null` if there was nothing to be retrieved).

```javascript
Selligent.getLastRemotePushNotification(
    (response) => { // success callback
    }
)
```

### Broadcasts

You can subscribe to `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.RECEIVED_REMOTE_NOTIFICATION`, `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.WILL_DISPLAY_NOTIFICATION`, `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.WILL_DISMISS_NOTIFICATION` and `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.BUTTON_CLICKED` events through the `Selligent.subscribeToEvents`.
The response of the success callback is an object which contains information on the type of broadcast event and the data attached to it.

| Property           | Type                                                    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| broadcastEventType | [enum](#broadcasteventtype)                             | The type of broadcast event                                       |
| data               | object                                                  | Contains more information specific to the type of broadcast event |

The `data` property is an object itself containing more information specific to the type of the broadcast event:

- RECEIVED_REMOTE_NOTIFICATION:

    | Property | Type   | Description                                |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
    | pushId   | string | The id of the remote push notification     |
    | name     | string | The title of the remote push notification  |

- WILL_DISPLAY_NOTIFICATION and WILL_DISMISS_NOTIFICATION: the `data` prop is `null`.

- BUTTON_CLICKED:

    | Property | Type                                                                       | Description                             |
    | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | type     | iOS: [enum](#notificationbuttontype)                                       | Tye type of the button (deeplink, url...) |
    | value    | string                                                                     | The value of the button (url value, deeplink value...)  |
    | id       | string                                                                     | The internal id of the button               |
    | label    | string                                                                     | The label of the button       |
    | data     | object                                                                     | Additional data embedded to the button   |

```javascript
Selligent.subscribeToEvents(
    () => {}, 
    () => {},
    (response) => {
      Alert.alert(response.broadcastEventType + ' - ' + JSON.stringify(response.data))
    }
)
```

## In-App Messages

To enable them all you need to do is to set the proper [inAppMessageRefreshType](#inappmessagerefreshtype) value in the `selligent.json`.

You can later call the `Selligent.enableInAppMessages` function (if you want) to further optin/optout from the functionality; this function expects an `enabled` parameter that can either be a boolean or an [enum](#inappmessagerefreshtype) value.

> On iOS, if you are using the enum variant when calling the `Selligent.enableInAppMessages` method, it will not change the recurrency of the check for new messages but just enable/disable it. The source of truth for the recurrency is the `selligent.json`.

```javascript
// To enable in-app messages
Selligent.enableInAppMessages(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    (error) => { // error callback
    },
    true
)
```

### Display IAM

You can subscribe to `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.RECEIVED_IN_APP_MESSAGE` events through the `Selligent.subscribeToEvents`, to know when new messages are received.
The response of the success callback is an object which contains information on the type of broadcast event and the data attached to it.

| Property           | Type                                                    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| broadcastEventType | [enum](#broadcasteventtype)                             | The type of broadcast event                                       |
| data               | object                                                  | Contains more information specific to the type of broadcast event |

The `data` property is an object itself containing more information specific to the type of the broadcast event:

- RECEIVED_IN_APP_MESSAGE

    | Property | Type  | Description      |
    | -------- | ----- | ---------------- |
    | messages | array | List of messages |

    And the detailed overview for items in the `messages` array is:

    | Property | Type   | Description        |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------------ |
    | id       | string | Internal id of the message |
    | title    | string | Title of the message |

```javascript
Selligent.subscribeToEvents(
    () => {}, 
    () => {},
    (response) => {
      if (response?.broadcastEventType === SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.RECEIVED_IN_APP_MESSAGE) {
      }
    }
)
```

You can also call `Selligent.getInAppMessages` anywhere in your App to get the list of the currently known IAM.

```javascript
// Get all in app messages
Selligent.getInAppMessages(
    (response) => { // success callback
    }
)
```

The response of the success callback is an array of objects which contain the in app message(s) information:

| Property       | Type                                                                            | Description                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| id             | string                                                                          | Internal id of the IAM                                 |
| title          | string                                                                          | Title of the IAM                               |
| body           | string                                                                          | Body of the IAM. For message of type `ALERT` it will be the text corresponding to the body of the Alert, for type `HTML` it will be the html code, for type `URL`, `IMAGE` and `PASSBOOK` it will be an URL.                          |
| type           | [enum](#inappmessagetype) | Type of the IAM                                  |
| creationDate   | number                                                                          | Creation date of the IAM in unix time            |
| expirationDate | number                                                                          | Expiration date of the IAM in unix time         |
| receptionDate  | number                                                                          | Reception date of the IAM in unix time             |
| hasBeenSeen    | boolean                                                                         | Indication if the IAM is already seen                    |
| buttons        | array of objects                                                                | Buttons that are linked to the IAM   |

The `buttons` property is an array of button-objects which contain the information of a button linked to the in app message:

| Property | Type   | Description                                | Platform     |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| id       | string | Id of the button of the in app message     | Both         |
| label    | string | Label of the button of the in app message  | Both         |
| value    | string | Value of the button of the in app message  | Both         |
| type     | number | Type of the button of the in app message   | Both         |

- When the IAM is linked to a push notification, you can set `customInAppUi` to `true` in `selligent.json` and subscribe to `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.DISPLAYING_IN_APP_MESSAGE` events through the `Selligent.subscribeToEvents`, to know when messages are about to be displayed.
You will also need to set `addInAppMessageFromPushToInAppMessageList` to `true` in `selligent.json` to be able to retrieve the full object calling `Selligent.getInAppMessages` and do not forget to use the [IAM Helper methods](#iam-helper-methods) to properly track Open and Click interactions.
For Android, to avoid the SDK directly displaying the IAM if the App is in foreground, do also set `remoteMessageDisplayType` to `22` (NOTIFICATION) in `selligent.json`.
The response of the success callback is an object which contains information on the type of broadcast event and the data attached to it.

| Property           | Type                                                    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| broadcastEventType | [enum](#broadcasteventtype)                             | The type of broadcast event                                       |
| data               | object                                                  | Contains more information specific to the type of broadcast event |

The `data` property is an object itself containing more information specific to the type of the broadcast event:

- DISPLAYING_IN_APP_MESSAGE

    | Property | Type   | Description        |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------------ |
    | id       | string | Internal id of the message |
    | title    | string | Title of the message |

```javascript
Selligent.subscribeToEvents(
    () => {}, 
    () => {},
    (response) => {
      if (response?.broadcastEventType === SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.DISPLAYING_IN_APP_MESSAGE) {
      }
    }
)
```

To display any of these messages, you can call `Selligent.displayMessage`:

### Selligent.displayMessage

Display an IAM based on its `id`, which is a string that needs to be passed to the method with the `messageId` parameter.
You can optionally pass a `templateId` parameter, which is a string, to specify which template should be used to personalize the styles of the inapp message (if any), this will only be used on iOS.

```javascript
Selligent.displayMessage(
  (response) => { // success callback
  },
  (error) => { // error callback
  },
  "some message id",
  "some template id" // (iOS only) If you want to use any specific template
)
```

#### IAM Customization - Android

On Android, if you want to customize the IAM styles, you can refer to the [native documentation](https://github.com/SelligentMarketingCloud/MobileSDK-Android/tree/master/Documentation#design-customization).

#### IAM Customization - iOS

On iOS, if you want to customize the IAM styles, you can define the templates, to do so you will need to do it in the native part, in the `UIAppDelegate/didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method by calling the `RNSelligent/setInAppMessageStylingTemplates:defaultTemplateId:` method, which expects an array of templates and (optionally) a default template id. If the default template is set, it will be used for all type of in-app messages (when a templateId wasn't provided or couldn't be found) and you will not need to use any specific templateId anywhere around your App.

In the other hand, you can also use the native methods `RNSelligent/willPresentNotification:templateId:withCompletionHandler:` and `RNSelligent/didReceiveNotificationResponse:templateId:withCompletionHandler:` if you want to give different styles to the in app messages that are displayed based on a push message.

> You can refer to the [native documentation](https://github.com/SelligentMarketingCloud/MobileSDK-iOS/tree/master/Documentation#styling-iam) to know more about all possible customizations that are offered.

```objective-c
@import RNSelligentMobileSDK;
@import SelligentMobileSDK;
// OR
// #import <RNSelligentMobileSDK/RNSelligentMobileSDK-Swift.h>
// #import <MapKit/MapKit.h>
// #import <WebKit/WebKit.h>
// #import <SelligentMobileSDK/SMHelperSwift.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
  center.delegate = self;

  // RN Setup code
  
  [RNSelligent configureWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
  
  // Example style templates
  SMInAppMessageStyleOptions* styleOptions = [[SMInAppMessageStyleOptions alloc] init];
  styleOptions.presentWithTransition = true;
  styleOptions.transition = kSMViewTransition_VerticalSlide;
  
  InAppMessageStylingTemplate* defaultTemplate = [[InAppMessageStylingTemplate alloc] initWithTemplateId:@"defaultTemplate" styleOptions:styleOptions];
  
  SMInAppMessageStyleOptions* styleOptionsUseCase2 = [[SMInAppMessageStyleOptions alloc] init];
  styleOptionsUseCase2.presentWithTransition = true;
  styleOptionsUseCase2.transition = kSMViewTransition_HorizontalSlide;
  
  InAppMessageStylingTemplate* templateUseCase2 = [[InAppMessageStylingTemplate alloc] initWithTemplateId:@"usecase2" styleOptions:styleOptionsUseCase2];
  
  [RNSelligent setInAppMessageStylingTemplates:@[ defaultTemplate, templateUseCase2 ] defaultTemplateId:@"defaultTemplate"];

  return YES;
}
```

### IAM Helper methods

If you decide to display the IAM on your own (without `Selligent.displayMessage` and `Selligent.displayNotification`), listening for new messages with the `Selligent.subscribeToEvents` and/or getting the full list with `Selligent.getInAppMessages`. You will be able to build your own layout with the object provided from the mentioned functions and then you can use the helper methods described here to still push KPI statistics to the Marigold Engage platform:

- setInAppMessageAsSeen: sets an IAM as seen and sends the corresponding `Opened` event to the Marigold Engage platform

    ```javascript
    Selligent.setInAppMessageAsSeen(
        (response) => { // success callback
        },
        (error) => { // error callback
        },
        "id-of-message"
    )
    ```

- setInAppMessageAsUnseen: sets an IAM as unseen

    ```javascript
    Selligent.setInAppMessageAsUnseen(
        (response) => { // success callback
        },
        (error) => { // error callback
        },
        "id-of-message"
    )
    ```

- setInAppMessageAsDeleted: sets an IAM as deleted

    ```javascript
    Selligent.setInAppMessageAsDeleted(
        (response) => { // success callback
        },
        (error) => { // error callback
        },
        "id-of-message"
    )
    ```

- executeButtonAction: executes the action linked to an IAM button and sends the corresponding `Clicked` event to the Marigold Engage platform

    ```javascript
    Selligent.executeButtonAction(
        (response) => { // success callback
        },
        (error) => { // error callback
        },
        "id-of-button",
        "id-of-message"
    )
    ```

## Events

Sending any set of data to the backend can be done with `Selligent.sendEvent`.
The method accepts an `event` object which requires certain properties, depending on the type of the event:

| Property    | Type                                  | Description      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| type        | [enum](#eventtype)                    | The type of event to send |
| email       | string                                | The custom profile identifier (`mail` in our v1 platform) of the user as a String. |
| data        | object                                | Additional data you want to provide to Marigold Engage (you can specify here a key/value pair to use as an alternative lookup for your device identification process) |

For events of type `SelligentConstants.EventType.CUSTOM` the `data` property is mandatory.

```javascript
Selligent.sendEvent(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    (error) => { // error callback
    },
    {
        type: SelligentConstants.EventType.USER_LOGIN,
        data: { // optional
            description: "this is some extra information concerning this event"
        },
        email: "someone@somedomain.com"
    }
)
Selligent.sendEvent(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    (error) => { // error callback
    },
    {
        type: SelligentConstants.EventType.CUSTOM,
        data: { // required
            description: "this is some extra information concerning this event"
        }
    }
)
```

## Miscellaneous

### Get lib version

Returns the version of the installed native Marigold Engage SDK (string).

```javascript
Selligent.getVersionLib((versionLib) => {
})
```

### Get device id

Returns the currently known Marigold Engage device Id (string).

```javascript
Selligent.getDeviceId((deviceId) => {
})
```

You can also subscribe to the `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.RECEIVED_DEVICE_ID` event through the `Selligent.subscribeToEvents`, to know when a new device is received.
The response of the success callback is an object which contains information on the type of broadcast event and the data attached to it.

| Property           | Type                                                    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| broadcastEventType | [enum](#broadcasteventtype)                             | The type of broadcast event                                       |
| data               | object                                                  | Contains more information specific to the type of broadcast event |

The `data` property is an object itself containing more information specific to the type of the broadcast event:

- RECEIVED_DEVICE_ID

    | Property | Type   | Description                     |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
    | deviceId | string | The Marigold Engage id of the device  |

### Logging

For iOS, you can use `Selligent.enableiOSLogging` passing the desired logLevel.

```javascript
// to enable logging of info, warning and error statements
Selligent.enableiOSLogging(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    (error) => { // error callback
    },
    [Selligent.iOSLogLevel.INFO]
)
```

For Android, you can use `Selligent.enableAndroidLogging` passing the enabled flag.

```javascript
Selligent.enableAndroidLogging(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    (error) => { // error callback
    },
    true
)
```

### GCM Token - Android

To get the current token being used, you can call `Selligent.getGCMToken` which will return it (string).

```javascript
Selligent.getGCMToken(
  (response) => { // success callback
  }
)
```

To set the token manually (if you integrate with GCM directly and do set `doNotFetchTheToken` property to `true`), you can call `Selligent.setFirebaseToken`

```javascript
Selligent.setFirebaseToken(
    (response) => { // success callback
    },
    (error) => { // error callback
    },
    "token value"
)
```

You can also subscribe to the `SelligentConstants.BroadcastEventType.RECEIVED_GCM_TOKEN` event through the `Selligent.subscribeToEvents`, to know when a new token is received.
The response of the success callback is an object which contains information on the type of broadcast event and the data attached to it.

| Property           | Type                                                    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| broadcastEventType | [enum](#broadcasteventtype)                             | The type of broadcast event                                       |
| data               | object                                                  | Contains more information specific to the type of broadcast event |

The `data` property is an object itself containing more information specific to the type of the broadcast event:

- RECEIVED_GCM_TOKEN

    | Property | Type   | Description                     |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
    | token    | string | The token attached to the event |

| USER_REGISTER   | number | 90    | Used to send a register event to the server with the custom email/profile identifier of the user, with the purpose of linking the device to an user and optionally storing some data at Marigold Engage platform side. This event will create a new user in your Marigold Engage database, if none was found (you can use an alternate key/value field to search for the user, in the data object, since by default the `email` one will use the `MAIL` column in your Marigold Engage database). |
| USER_UNREGISTER | number | 91    | Used to send an unregister event to the server with the custom email/profile identifier of the user, with the purpose of keeping track of a REGISTERED flag and optionally storing some data at Marigold Engage platform side (this event is not unlinking the user from the device (automatically), at the moment). |
| USER_LOGIN      | number | 92    | Used to send a login event to the server with the custom email/profile identifier of the user, with the purpose of linking the device to an user and optionally storing some data at Marigold Engage platform side.

| USER_LOGOUT     | number | 93    | Used to send a logout event to the server with the custom email/profile identifier of the user, with the purpose of keeping track of a LOGGED flag and optionally storing some data at Marigold Engage platform side (this event is not unlinking the user from the device (automatically), at the moment). |
| CUSTOM          | number | 94    | Used to send a custom event to the server, with the purpose of keeping track of storing some data at Marigold Engage platform side. |

### NotificationButtonType

Defines the type of buttons for notifications or inapp messages.

| Name                          | Type   | Value | Description                               |
